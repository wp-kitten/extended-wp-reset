#. Description of the plugin
msgid ""
"This plugin is based on WP Dev's <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-"
"reset/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Reset</a> plugin. In comparison to the "
"original version, this plugin offers support for MultiSite installations and "
"also correctly deletes tables that have foreign key constraints. This plugin "
"does not delete any other plugins, files or themes that exist on your "
"WordPress installation, it only deletes/empties the tables from the database "
"thus reverting WordPress to its default state. The current user will also be "
"recreated using the same user name and password."
